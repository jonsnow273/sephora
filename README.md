> **"Can an AI assistant's observable behavior be systematically controlled by modifying internal model activations rather than engineering system prompts?"**

**Sephora** is an experimental, privacy-first local AI assistant that explores controlling an LLM's observable behavior through **activation-level interventions** during the forward pass. While conventional assistants rely entirely on prompt engineering to tweak their tone and behavior, Sephora demonstrates how the exact same model weights and the exact same user prompt can yield radically different behavioral characteristics—such as **concise**, **cautious**, **detailed**, or **creative** responses—by directly steering internal residual stream representations.

Alongside this mechanistic research core, Sephora remains a fully functional, user-friendly personal desktop assistant featuring **local multilingual voice interaction**, **safe whitelisted PC automation**, and a **modern React + Tailwind dashboard**.

## 🔬 Activation Steering: Core Research Contribution

### The Core Innovation: Activation Steering vs. Prompt Engineering

Most modern AI assistants modify behavior by altering instructions in token space (e.g., adding *"You are a concise assistant"* to the prompt). While intuitive, prompt-based conditioning is fundamentally constrained: it consumes valuable context tokens, can be overridden by user prompt injections, and lacks continuous calibration.

Sephora intervenes at the **representation level**:

```
Traditional Prompt Approach:
  [ User Prompt ] + [ Long Behavioral System Prompt ] ──► [ Standard Forward Pass ] ──► Output

Sephora Activation Steering:
  [ User Prompt ] ──────────────────────────────────────► [ Transformer Layers ]
                                                                   │
                                                      Layer L: x' = x + α · v_direction
                                                                   │
                                                                   ▼
                                                          [ Steered Generation ]
```

### Why Activation-Level Intervention Matters:
- **Zero Token Overhead**: Leaves the full context window available for conversation and document context.
- **Continuous Quantitative Control**: Instead of binary prompt requests, behavior intensity is modulated continuously via a scalar multiplier $\alpha \in [-3.0, +3.0]$.
- **Prompt-Injection Resilience**: Because behavioral constraints reside in internal activation geometry rather than token prompts, user inputs cannot trivially bypass them.
- **Mechanistic Explainability**: Provides real-time visibility into internal layer activations and vector projections rather than treating the LLM as an unobservable black box.

## 📊 Side-by-Side Observable Behavior

Using the built-in **Steering Comparison Lab**, users and researchers can run identical prompts through baseline and steered conditions to observe immediate behavioral shifts:

| Prompt | Unsteered Baseline (α = 0) | Steered Output | Active Preset & Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| *"Explain TCP vs. UDP"* | "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two foundational communication protocols used in computer networking. TCP is connection-oriented..." *(134 words)* | "TCP guarantees ordered, error-checked delivery via handshakes. UDP transmits connectionless datagrams with minimal latency, accepting packet loss." *(19 words)* | **`concise` (α = +1.8)**<br>*-85% length reduction, zero conversational preamble* |
| *"Delete the old project build folder."* | "I'll go ahead and remove the folder old_build from your workspace directory." | "CAUTION: Deleting `old_build` will erase all compile outputs. Ensure no dependent processes require these assets. Confirmation required: [Approve / Cancel]." | **`cautious` (α = +2.0)**<br>*Elevates risk awareness and surfaces safety boundaries* |
| *"Brainstorm a name for an asynchronous task queue."* | "Here are some good names for an asynchronous task queue: TaskFlow, AsyncQueue, JobRunner, WorkQueue." | "Consider metaphors of celestial momentum and river flow: *ChronoTide*, *AetherRelay*, *VortexDispatch*, *PulseWeave*." | **`creative` (α = +1.5)**<br>*Expands associative diversity without temperature noise* |

## 🎛️ System Capabilities & Feature Hierarchy

### 1. 🔬 Activation Steering Lab (Primary Research Core)
- **Mechanistic Hooks**: Integrates **TransformerLens** to intercept and patch residual stream states (`hook_resid_post`) during inference.
- **Calibrated Behavioral Presets**: Built-in vectors for `cautious`, `concise`, `detailed`, `creative`, and `neutral`.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison Interface**: Test any prompt simultaneously across unsteered and steered paths.
- **Live Visual Telemetry**: Layer activation heatmaps and interactive strength sliders powered by Recharts.
- **Vector Math**: Extract new behavioral directions from contrastive prompt pairs using mean-difference and PCA pipelines.

### 2. 💬 Local Conversational Core
- 100% private, on-device text generation powered by open-weight models (**Mistral 7B Instruct** or **Gemma-2-2B**).
- 4-bit / 8-bit quantization support via `bitsandbytes` to run smoothly on consumer GPUs (4-8 GB VRAM) or CPU.
- Multi-turn conversation persistence with structured session logging.

### 3. 🛡️ Safe PC Automation Agent
- Translates natural language requests into structured, whitelisted desktop actions.
- **Strict Whitelist**: Can only execute safe actions listed in `configs/automation_whitelist.yaml`.
- **Mandatory Confirmation Gate**: Destructive actions (deleting files, overwriting directories) explicitly trigger a visual confirmation prompt before execution.
- **Recycle Bin Protection**: Employs `send2trash` to prevent irreversible file destruction.
- **Whitelisted Handlers**: File management, application launching, system search, audio playback, and VS Code code generation.

### 4. 🎙️ Multilingual Voice Interaction
- Low-overhead, always-on wake word engine: **"Hey Sephora"** via local `openWakeWord`.
- High-accuracy local speech-to-text via **OpenAI Whisper** (`medium` or `large-v3`).
- Native language detection and support for **6 primary languages** (configurable in `configs/languages.yaml`).
- Transcribed speech streams directly into the same intent and steering pipeline as typed input.

## 🤝 Team Contribution & Research Collaboration

Sephora is actively developed as a modular research project. We follow structured peer reviews and strict branch naming conventions. Please review [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting pull requests.

## ⚖️ Scientific Rigor & Limitations
Sephora is an experimental system. We explicitly acknowledge observed research limitations:
1. **Saturation Limits**: Steering values |α| > 2.8 can degrade grammar or trigger token repetition.
2. **Quantization Effects**: 4-bit quantization slightly degrades steering vector resolution relative to FP16.
3. **Task Generalization**: Vectors derived from conversational corpora may show reduced efficacy on specialized syntax tasks (e.g., deep code compilation).

See [`docs/experiments.md`](docs/experiments.md) for full evaluation metrics and failure mode analyses.
